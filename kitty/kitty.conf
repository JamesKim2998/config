# =============================================================================
# Focus Reporting - DISABLED
# =============================================================================
# Disables terminal focus reporting escape sequences (\e[?1004h).
#
# Why: When enabled, Kitty sends focus-in (\e[I) and focus-out (\e[O) escape
# sequences when the window gains/loses focus. Some CLI apps (e.g., Claude Code)
# don't properly consume these sequences, causing "[I" and "[O" to appear as
# literal text when switching tabs (Cmd+Shift+[/]) or focusing in/out.
#
# Trade-offs:
# - Vim/Neovim FocusGained/FocusLost auto-commands won't fire
# - tmux focus-events won't work
# - TUI apps that respond to focus changes won't detect them
